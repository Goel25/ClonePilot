# ClonePilot
### A worse version of GitHub Copilot

By query stackoverflow, I have compiled a database of javascript functions, their parameters and bodies.
In VS Code, you can search for and insert these functions, similar to Github Copilot.

This repo is the server code. For the vscode extension go to [ClonePilotExtension](https://github.com/Goel25/ClonePilotExtension).
