# ClonePilot
### A worse version of GitHub Copilot

By quering stackoverflow, I have compiled a database of javascript functions, their parameters and bodies.
In VS Code, you can search for and insert these functions, similar to Github Copilot.

# Video
Check out this youtube video explaining how I made it!
